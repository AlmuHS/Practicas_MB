MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGH UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES (MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS UNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS LIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TO FALSIFICATION AND DISTORTION OF THE ORIGINAL . </field></doc></add>

MOST COMMON FORMS OF DAMAGE OCCUR THROUGH UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES (MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS UNAVOIDABLE.
